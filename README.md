# Helpful_Reviews

Can a computer predict whether a review is helpful from only the text? The answer is yes.

The Jupyter Notebooks above present Data Wrangling, EDA, and Machine Learning to predict helpful book reviews. The dataset includes 8.9 million rows of Amazon Book Reviews, made available by "Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering," R. He, J. McAuley, WWW, 2016.
